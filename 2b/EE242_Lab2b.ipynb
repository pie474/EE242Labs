    "## Assignment 2 -- Smoothing Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we’ll implement a moving window smoothing function to show how you can use convolution to remove noise from a signal. We’ll use a discrete signal associated with a sampling period, and plot signals as if they were continuous to make it easier to see the effect of smoothing. The base signal is generated randomly, so you can run the cell multiple times to see how the results look for different signals.  This assignment will have three parts, A-C.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.**  Using the starter code provided, create a base time signal and a noisy version of it by adding random noise generated with the numpy.random.randn() function (the standard normal distribution, which is zero mean and unit variance). Plot the original and noisy signals with 2x1 subplots, with the time axis labeled assuming a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Constrain the y-axis to be [0,25] for all plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "**B.**  Create a smoothed version of the signal called filtsig1 by computing the average value over a +/- k samples using the numpy.mean() function and k=20. You will need to make a decision as to how to handle the first and last k samples, for which there won’t be a full k samples available in both directions. In a single plot, plot the noisy signal and the filtered signal overlaid on the original signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.**  Define a vector hfilt that corresponds to box of length N=2k+1 and height 1/N. Create a second smoothed version of the signal called filtsig2 by convolving the base signal with hfilt using the numpy.convolve() function. Plot the two different filtered signal outputs overlaid on each other. Note that the convolve function will change the length, so you will need to define a new time vector for that. \n",
