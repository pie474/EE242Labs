It is commonly used for smoothing the data. For audio, applying low-pass filter removes high-pitched sound and upper harmonics, which results in a warm and muddy sound. For an image, applying low-pass filter removes sharp details, which results in a blurred image. \n",
            "- A **high-pass filter (HPF)** removes low-frequency components of the data, allowing only frequencies higher than the cut-off frequency to pass through. It is commonly used for removing DC component from the signal and for extracting details from the data. For audio, applying a high-pass filter removes the bass component, which results in a sharp and crispy sound.\n",

For an FIR filter, there is little difference between the two options in terms of computational cost if you use the equations directly. (A common implementation of the convolve function is actually more efficient for reasons that you’ll learn in EE342.) However, for an IIR filter, the computation for each time step of a convolution involves an infinite sum, so using the finite coefficient equation above is more practical. In Python, LTI digital filters can be implemented using the lfilter function from the signal module: \n",

The convolution used an impulse response h[n] that was a causal version of the moving average window.

Plot the original and noisy signals together with the original overlaid on the noisy version, with the time axis labeled assuming a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Constrain the y-axis to be [0,25] for all plots. Include a legend with the plot.\n",

Create a second version called filtsig2 by using the signal.lfilter function. Recall that for the FIR filter, the impulse response is equal to the b coefficient vector. Plot the two filtered signals overlaid. Recall that the convolve function will change the length, so you will need to define a new time vector for that. You should find that the two methods give the same result except for edge effects.\n",
